# FCE-to-OBJ
Convert Need for Speed 3 FCE format files to OBJ for use within 3D modelling programs/game engines.

U/V coords read in but not currently used for texture mapping; I am working on this.  Sometimes its buggy with  some community created fce files, but I have not extensively tested any aspect of this (hahaha).

To run (for now):

Place car.fce in build directory and compile. Output is in same directory called Model.obj.
