                T3ED SOURCE CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT
=========================================================================

T3ED is copyright (c) Denis Auroux, 1998-99 (auroux@math.polytechnique.fr)

This document describes the conditions under which the source code of
T3ED is made available to other developpers. If you don't agree with
the terms of this license then you are not allowed to use T3ED's source
code for any purpose.

=========================================================================

1. T3ED's source code is provided as is ; no support will be provided,
   neither concerning this source code nor about how to re-use it for
   other projects.

2. All products based on all or part of T3ED's source code must be made
   available for free ; if distributed to anyone they must be made freely
   available to everyone on the Internet (modifications made for private
   use only and not released to any third party are exempt from these
   requirements). It is strictly forbidden to sell any product
   derived from this code.

3. The source code of all products based on all or part of T3ED's source
   code must be publicly available ; the executable files should come
   either with a zip archive of the source code or with an Internet link
   pointing to the source code. The source code itself must be provided
   with this license agreement document attached to it.

4. User support for modified versions of T3ED will be under the entire
   responsibility of the author of the modifications. Moreover, reference
   must be made to the official T3ED download site in the About dialog box
   and in the help file. On the contrary, ALL OCCURRENCES OF MY E-MAIL
   ADDRESS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MODIFIED SOFTWARE AND FROM THE
   ACCOMPANYING HELP FILE.

5. Version numbering and copyright statements for all T3ED-based
   developments must follow strictly the following rules, so as to
   avoid any complications in user support :

 a) modified versions of T3ED (i.e. software whose main function is
    to create or modify NFS tracks and whose general interface and
    operating principle are similar to those of T3ED) :

  * The version number should start with the original T3ED version number
    followed by the initials of the person who made the modifications and
    the version number of these modifications. For example, if your initials
    are R.M., the third modified version of T3ED based on version 0.06
    should be labelled version 0.06-RM-3.

  * The copyright statement displayed in the About box must contain
    the version number, the original copyright line, the name of the
    author of the modifications, the e-mail address and WWW address of
    the author of the modifications, and finally the original T3ED download
    site. In other words this notice should be of the following form :

               T3ED Version 0.xx-XX-x
               Copyright (C) Denis Auroux, 1998-99
               Modified by Xxxxx Xxxx
               e-mail: xxx@xxx.xxx
               http://xxx.xxx/xxx
               http://www.math.polytechnique.fr/cmat/auroux/nfs/

   * The main help file should also mention the information listed above :
     the name and e-mail address of the author of the modifications must be
     mentioned, as well as the version number and the original copyright
     statement. All references to my e-mail address must be removed, while
     the original download web page must be mentioned at least once.

 b) other T3ED-based developments :

   * The About dialog box must mention that portions of the code are
     copyright (c) Denis Auroux 1998-99.

   * The help file must include a similar notice and must provide a link
     to the main T3ED download web page
     (http://www.math.polytechnique.fr/cmat/auroux/nfs/).

===========================================================================

Notes about the source code :

- the T3ED source code is meant to be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0.
  Changes will have to be made if another version of Visual C++ or another
  C++ compiler are to be used instead. In any case, the last two lines of
  the file HLP\T3ED.HPJ have to be modified according to your installation
  settings.

- remember that the above requirements apply to all occurrences of the
  copyright notices ; this includes one occurrence in the README.TXT file,
  one occurrence in the About dialog box, and three occurrences in the
  help file. Another reference to my e-mail address (in the FAQ part of
  the help file) also needs to be deleted.

- please send me an e-mail when you release a T3ED-based product ! I will
  try to set up a page with links to the download pages of all existing
  modified versions, so that the various people working on T3ED can be
  more easily kept informed of the latest developements.

        Denis.
