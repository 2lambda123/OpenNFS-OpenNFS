New in this version
===================
- v1.01 : changed the naming convention for FSH2BMP in order to ensure
  the uniqueness of filenames ; this makes it possible to edit TR040.QFS
  from NFS3. BMP2FSH was not modified.

Presentation
============

The QFS Editing Suite is a software collection that allows you to convert
the .QFS and .FSH graphics files from the various versions of The Need
For Speed to the standard .BMP graphics format, so you can view them and
edit them with your favorite paint software before re-importing them back
in the game.

The QFS Editing suite is compatible with all existing Need For Speed
releases (PC versions) ; extensive testing was performed with TNFS, NFS2,
the NFS2SE demo and the NFS3 demo. It allows one to view and modify, among
others : the car slides (all versions), track loading screens (NFS2 and
above), track graphics (NFS2 and above), car dashboards (all versions),
general game interface (all versions), ...

It consists of :

- QFS2FSH, which expands compressed QFS files into uncompressed FSH files
  (thanks to Ian Brown for his description of the QFS format)

- FSH2QFS, which does the reverse job of creating compressed QFS files

- FSH2BMP, which converts a FSH file into a directory of Windows bitmaps.

- BMP2FSH, which does the reverse job of reassembling a FSH file.

All these tools are to be run from a DOS window inside Windows 95/NT.

No graphics editing software is included ; the created BMP files have been
checked for compatibility with various usual programs. In particular, it is
possible to view and edit the BMP files in the standard Windows 95/NT Paint
software (available from the Start menu in the Accessories section).
Shareware tools like ACDSee can be used to browse and preview the files.


Bugs
====

- More testing should be done, especially with NFSSE which I don't own.

- The FSH2QFS compressor is extremely slow. Maybe sometime I'll rewrite it
  in assembler, but meanwhile please be patient.

- FSH2QFS and QFS2FSH do not work with DOS or Windows 3.x because they're
  32-bit software. On the contrary, FSH2BMP and BMP2FSH are DOS programs
  and do not understand long file names. Sorry.

- The amount of editing allowed is restricted. In particular the bitmap
  geometries and color palettes cannot be modified, because such a change
  is very likely to cause a bug in NFS !

- QFS2FSH sometimes refuses to uncompress certain files for no clear reason.


Operation : QFS2FSH
===================

Simply run "QFS2FSH filename.QFS filename.FSH" at a DOS prompt inside Windows.

- If you get a Windows system error, this simply means that the filenames you
  have supplied are not valid (e.g. the specified QFS file does not exist).
- If you get the laconic message "BUG OUTBUFFER", it means that an unknown
  error has occurred (probably a memory allocation problem). You can't do much
  about it, but it should occur only with very few files.


Operation : FSH2QFS
===================

Simply run "FSH2QFS filename.FSH filename.QFS" at a DOS prompt inside Windows.

- If you get a Windows system error, this simply means that the filenames you
have supplied are not valid (e.g. the specified FSH file does not exist).
- To help you wait during the lengthy compression process, FSH2QFS displays
a series of numbers. These numbers indicate the number of bytes processed in
the FSH file, and compression is finished when the size of the FSH file is
reached.

Operation : FSH2BMP
===================

Simply run "FSH2BMP filename.FSH directory" at any DOS prompt.

- The specified directory must either not exist, or be empty. For safety
  reasons, you cannot expand a FSH file to a non-empty directory, and you'll
  get an error message if you try to do so. I know it's annoying, but
  otherwise it's just too easy to lose important data.

- FSH2BMP informs you during the conversion on what it finds inside the FSH
  file. Currently 6 different types of bitmaps and 5 types of palettes are
  understood, and should cover all existing FSH/QFS files up to NFS3.

- Checking information, and all the information that cannot be put in the
  BMP files, is put in a FSH structure information file called SHPI.DAT
  in the target directory. You mustn't alter or delete this file, or it
  will be impossible to reconstruct the original FSH file from the bitmaps.

Error messages and their explanation :

- FSH file not found !
    The specified FSH file does not exist.

- This is not a FSH file !
    The specified file does not appear to be a FSH file.

- ERROR: target directory is not empty, or could not be created.
    The target directory must either be empty or not exist.

- Unknown palette structure !!! Filling with black
    A bitmap had a palette format that could not be recognized. You won't
    be able to view or edit it properly.

- Unknown data type (code ...)
    One of the objects in the FSH structure has a format that cannot be
    recognized. You can't do anything with it.

- Runtime error ...
    You caused an internal error. Possible causes : the disk is full ;
    one of the bitmaps is more than 4096 pixels wide ; bad luck ...


Operation : BMP2FSH
===================

Simply run "BMP2FSH directory filename.FSH" at any DOS prompt.

Error messages and their explanation :

- ERROR: directory does not exist or does not contain SHPI.DAT
    The specified directory does not exist or does not contain a file
    called SHPI.DAT

- SHPI.DAT does not have a valid header !
    The SHPI.DAT file is corrupted, reconstruction is not possible.
    Or, we're past year 2000, there's a new version, and you're trying
    to use an old version of BMP2FSH with a new version of FSH2BMP.

- Cannot create FSH file !
    The FSH file could not be created, possibly because its name is not
    valid or because your disk is full.

- ERROR ! Cannot find the global palette - Aborting.
    The global palette file whose name is given just above the error message
    was accidentally destroyed. Reconstruction is not possible.

- ERROR ! Incoherent byte offset - Aborting.
    The file sizes are not coherent in the SHPI.DAT information file.
    It was accidentally corrupted, or you found a bug in the converter.
    If you got this message and are sure you didn't do anything wrong,
    please e-mail me with a precise description of what you did.

- ERROR ! Cannot find file - Aborting.
    The data or bitmap file whose name is given just above the error message
    could not be found, it was probably accidentally destroyed. Reconstruction
    is not possible.

- ERROR ! Invalid type tag encountered - Aborting.
    The SHPI.DAT file is corrupted, reconstruction is not possible.
    Or, we're past year 2000, there's a new version, and you're trying
    to use an old version of BMP2FSH with a new version of FSH2BMP.

- ERROR ! Not a valid BMP file - Aborting.
  ERROR ! Unsupported BMP format - Aborting.
  ERROR ! Compressed BMP files not allowed - Aborting.
    The bitmap file whose name is above the error message is apparently not
    in plain uncompressed BMP format. Check the save options of your graphics
    editing software to see if it doesn't do anything weird. If this persists
    revert to Windows Paint.

- ERROR ! Incorrect BMP geometry (width and/or height) - Aborting.
    You're not allowed to change the size of the bitmaps.

- ERROR ! Abnormal padding before local palette - Aborting.
    The original FSH file contained a subtle data structure problem that
    makes reconstruction impossible. If you get this error message, please
    e-mail me with the name and origin of the FSH file you were editing.

- ERROR ! BMP palette has been modified - Aborting.
    You've changed the color palette, or your graphics software has done it
    for you. This is not allowed, so check the options of your graphics
    software, and if this message persists revert to Windows Paint.

- ERROR ! Incorrect BMP color depth (...) - Aborting.
  ERROR ! Unsupported BMP color depth - Aborting.
    The original bitmap was in 256-color mode or 16M-color mode, and you
    changed it to another format. Check you didn't mix files ; check the
    options of your graphics software.

- Unknown palette structure !!! Filling with black
    A bitmap had a palette format that could not be recognized. This is
    just a warning.

- Runtime error ...
    You caused an internal error. Possible causes : the disk is full ;
    one of the bitmaps is more than 4096 pixels wide ; bad luck ...
